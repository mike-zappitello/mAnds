Things that we need to both have
* tableau public for visualizatons
* github for content management
* vm somewhere for hosting
  * make sure steve can ssh into this for SQL querries

Programing things that need to be done
* write a crawler to get pbp updates
  * use scores.espn.go.com/nba/
* setup a db to store data wisely
* script to generate file readable in tableau
  * create a json dict ->.odata file for teams
  * SQL for play by play data (tableau can read directly)
  * maybe a .odata for player information
    * keep some kind of id for player across pbp and personal info
* setup site to view data (in real time???)

* Interactive Calendar for Stats
  * We want to have data on each and every game
  * filter out stats by player and by slice of time
    * who has the most assists in 1 weeks time
    * what did rws stats look like over the last 10 games
    * what are the spurs stats like for winning games
  *

* Salary Cap Scheduler?
